# Dynamic Colorbar Adjustable Legend

## General info
This is a research project that focuses on developing an usable widget that can change the color of a visualization dynamically. In other words, by changing the range of the data of the colorbar, the user would be able to see the change on the visualization. 

## Technologies
* HTML 5
* CSS
* D3.js 

## Features
* The user can drag the sliders which are over the colorbar and see which number either of the slider is on the colorbar
* The user can choose the colors the colorbar would be presented with (as a range, from one color to another)
* The user can choose the scale the colorbar would represent (as a range, from one number to another)

## Status
The project is open to further development in the future. Features such as letting the user decide the width and height of the colorbar is one thing that is to be implemented.
